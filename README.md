# RetrivingProductDetail

DESCRIPTION

Project objective:
Create a servlet-based application that shows a form to enter a product ID. The product ID is then validated, and product details are retrieved from the database and displayed to the user. You need to create a product table in MySQL and prepopulate it with data. Use JDBC to do all database processing.


Background of the problem statement:
As a part of developing an e-commerce web application, the admin backend requires a module that can retrieve product information based on the product ID.


You must use the following:

●    Eclipse as the IDE
●    Apache Tomcat as the web server
●    MySQL Connector for JDBC functionality
